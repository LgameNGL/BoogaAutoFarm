Not going to be updating this because the game is terrible and I don't have enough time.

Script information:
Seems like autopickup is broken, but level and gold farm still work.

PSU obfuscators don't work on KRNL so if you use that then it won't work.

Make sure to read the comments inside the scripts they tell you what to do.





Rant:
I recommend just quit the game, the mods are sensitive nerds so you'll get banned for pretty much anything.

The developer is a 13 ?? year old who got the position for the same reason why he's banning people.

Also, Soybeen doesn't care about his game to let someone like that run it. Even if it's for free, this is the same person who wanted a really good, experienced developer for
his other dead game, "Big Booga Dig."

If you're hoping for the game to revive, it won't happen. The community are trash snowflakes, and the owner doesn't care about the game.

Though the actual 2019 version (Pre c1.0) will always be the best version of Booga and the one most of us loved, this is also backed by stats. Pretty obvious that people don't like
your game when it drops from 10k on average to 2k over the course of a few months. Then have your game get overran by an old worse version of itself. Instead of listening
to the majority of the community, he listens to the few loud minorities who rarely even played the game to judge his decisions off of.

Sad to see, to be honest. A lot of people I know use to play booga but just quit after the trash C1.0 update. Too bad he ruined data enough in the original game to
not be able to fully restore people's hard work. Spam releasing shittier versions of the game with complete data wipes are *totally* gonna want people to come back. Not even new 
concepts or new core features, just straight up the same (worse version of Pre C1.0) game but everyone has their shit wiped.

I don't know where he gets his ideas from but most of the time they are terrible. Don't attempt to fix something that doesn't need fixing. Personally, instead of deciding what 
you think is the best action for the game, I would let the actual player base (not the loud minority) decide.

But that's what happens when you let fully grown women moderate a literal child's game who spent too much on discord and tell you what to do than exercising or eating a salad.
